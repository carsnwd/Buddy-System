![Buddy System](/assets/logo.png?raw=true)

It's always good advice to tell someone where you are going, especially for more dangerous situations such as hiking alone, meeting someone to sell something on Craiglist, or maybe on a blind date. Buddy System lets you specify a friend to text if you do not return from said activity, to check up on you such as "Hey -your name- hasn't returned from -activity- at -time expected back-, you should check up on them."

This app was created during the 12 hour MLH Local Hack Day hosted at York College.

Compatible with all modern Android API levels.


Things to add for the future...

-Get contact's number from your actual contact list instead of entering in the number.

-Geocode and send the location with Google Maps API or related API.
